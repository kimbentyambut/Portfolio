    description: "Developed a Python-based OCR automation tool to extract Australian energy futures pricing data from screenshots. The system uses OpenCV for preprocessing, EasyOCR for text recognition, and advanced regex cleaning to handle OCR inaccuracies. It parses both monthly and quarterly market data for multiple states (NSW, VIC, QLD, SA), organizes it by category (Base Month, Base Quarter, Caps, Peak Quarter), and stores results in MongoDB for structured retrieval. The solution includes automated cropping, data validation, error correction, and dynamic sorting to ensure clean, accurate, and ready-to-use market datasets for analytics or reporting.",
